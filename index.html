        <h1>Pollution on Earth</h1>
        <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.
        </p>
        <p>
		Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes. Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.
		</p>
		<p>
		All living things—from one-celled microbes to blue whales—depend on Earth’s supply of air and water. When these resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened.

                <p>Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside, pollution can spread to remote places where no people live. For example, pesticides and other chemicals have been found in the Antarctic ice sheet. In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p>

		Air and water currents carry pollution. Ocean currents and migrating fish carry marine pollutants far and wide. Winds can pick up radioactive material accidentally released from a nuclear reactor and scatter it around the world. Smoke from a factory in one country drifts into another country.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the past, visitors to Big Bend National Park in the U.S. state of Texas could see 290 kilometers (180 miles) across the vast landscape. Now, coal-burning power plants in Texas and the neighboring state of Chihuahua, Mexico have spewed so much pollution into the air that visitors to Big Bend can sometimes see only 50 kilometers (30 miles).

		<p>Local pollution is a pressing environmental issue that affects communities, ecosystems, and public health on a localized scale. It refers to the contamination or degradation of a specific area, often near the source of pollution, due to the release of harmful substances into the environment. While global environmental concerns like climate change often dominate headlines, local pollution has a significant and immediate impact on people's lives and the environment. This essay delves into the causes, effects, and mitigation strategies related to local pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
		Global pollution, often referred to as transboundary or international pollution, is a critical environmental issue that transcends national borders and affects ecosystems, climate systems, and human societies worldwide. Unlike local pollution, which impacts specific regions or communities, global pollution has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond individual countries. This essay explores the causes, effects, and potential solutions to this complex and interconnected environmental problem.

        Once released into the environment, pollution can affect wildlife habitats for years. It’s easy to blame factories, but some of the mess comes from everyday human activities. For instance, car exhaust fumes and excess garbage can seriously harm Earth’s health.

You can probably clean your room in a couple of hours. (At least we hope you can!) But you can’t cram Earth’s pollution problem into your closet. We all need to pitch in and clean up the planet. Look at it this way: Just like your room, it’s always better to prevent the Earth from getting dirty in the first place. Check out these tips for cutting down on your own personal waste.
